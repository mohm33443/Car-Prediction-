Car Prediction

This repository contains a project on predicting car-related outcomes using machine learning techniques. The project is implemented in Python within a Jupyter Notebook and involves data preprocessing, analysis, visualization, and model evaluation to achieve accurate predictions.

Introduction

The Car Prediction project aims to analyze and predict car characteristics or outcomes based on input data. This could be used for predicting car prices, efficiency, or other relevant attributes. Machine learning models are trained on a dataset to make these predictions.

Project Overview

This project follows these steps:

Data Loading and Exploration: Inspecting and understanding the dataset.

Data Visualization: Creating visual representations to derive insights.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data for machine learning models.

Model Training and Evaluation: Implementing machine learning algorithms and evaluating their performance.

Prediction: Using the trained model to make predictions on new data.
